## Core Components

- The `PotionItem` class contains all recipies, ingredients and their prices in one place for easier adjustments
- Every ingredient processing type should inherit from `PrepArea3D`
- The map is divided into zones which is managed by the `ModularMap` class and should inherit from the `Zone` class
- The `Trap` class should be inherited by all traps
- Each potion effect is implemented as their own scene and spawned by the `ThrowableItem` class after a collision

## Folder Structure

- Every potion effect should reside inside the `magic` folder
- Every zone should reside inside the `map/zone` folder
- Every block that can be placed on the map should be inside the `blocks` folder
